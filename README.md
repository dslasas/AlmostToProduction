# Almost to Production

Just a simple application to help track existing bugs (not necessarily change requests) for software projects. 
Currently this is just a bare-bones Java project in Spring-Boot using the Gradle build-tool.  

# Project Status
This project is currently in development. As of now, it is only the core of the application, which will be built out, so 
expect more behaviour in the near-future.
